Welcome to Fusion Center!
===================================

The smart sensor fusion system presents an innovative theoretical framework covering intelligent data fusion algorithms in detection, measurement and object levels using emerging signal processing theory, estimation theory and situation analysis approaches.

The multi-modality data from radar, lidar, and camera are properly processed, enabling high fidelity environment digitalization and comprehensive scene understanding. The resulting world model facilitates follow-up trajectory planning and adaptive control for real world autonomy.

The smart sensor fusion driven vehicles can operate autonomously with instant recognition and response to the surroundings in complicated environments at all weather conditions, in particular, using an adaptive mechanism to select the optimal data processing and fusion approaches in real time.

Please see the Fusion Center :docs:'Framework Design' for better understanding of the project components, :docs:'Sensors' for available sensors for the project, and :docs:'Simulations' for examples of Fusion Center features.
